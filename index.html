During my studies, I have developed technical skills in programming languages like Python, Java, and C, as well as in data analysis with NumPy and pandas. Iam also proficient in Microsoft Office, helping me organize and present my work effectively.</p>
        
        <p>Through various projects, Ihave gained hands-on experience in applying my skills to practical challenges. One of my key projects involved creating a data-driven application using Python and pandas to analyze large datasets, revealing valuable insights. Another project focused on developing a task management application in Java, deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming and enhancing my problem-solving abilities.</p>
        
        <p>Looking forward, I am excited to contribute to the IT industry as a Software Engineer. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that streamline processes, enhance user experiences, and drive efficiency. I am particularly interested in emerging technologies and aspire to be at the forefront of these advancements.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond academics, I am a badminton enthusiast and was a junior artist at Bangladesh Betar, where I recited poetry. I also love learning about psychology, reading books, and traveling. These interests inspire me to approach my work with creativity, empathy, and discipline.</p>
